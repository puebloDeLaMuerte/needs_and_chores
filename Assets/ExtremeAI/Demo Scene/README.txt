READ ME!!! Notes for Demo Scene included with Extreme AI ...

The Demo Scene folder contains the scripts created when following the QuickStart Guide for Extreme AI. The NPCInterface script is attached to the Buttons game object and tests Buttons' personality (in this very simple example, his feelings of intimidation). The output (in the Debug Log) shows his intimidation check score, a short quote based on this check, and then the result of events making him feel less intimidating over time.

(Note that the Buttons personality has been created in the Editor for you; you can change Buttons' initial scores by going to  Tools->Extreme AI->Character Editor in the menu, once Extreme AI is set up).

The scene continues by creating a new character personality for a character named "Zips." This personality is then added to the Zips game object, and then the ZipsInterface script is added to the game object as well. We then check that the script and character personality are working properly.

To really get an understanding of what these scripts are doing and how to use Extreme AI, please follow the QuickStart Guide from beginning to end, ideally in a new project.

Thanks for choosing Extreme AI! And feel free to contact us with any questions at support@quantumtigergames.com.
